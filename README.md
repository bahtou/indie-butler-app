This is the butler add on.
--------------------------

It has 2 purposes: back up your social activites locally so that you can access
them no matter what, always. Serve them thru open protocol to
other people/apps even if they do not use the same applications.

TODO:
* File Editing from the app itself... that's a bit tricky, but tha would be amazing.
* Auth on the server + registration
* PubSubhubbub support
* Support for domain names
* More interceptors, improve existing for better AS support.
* Historical imports. This will be useful for the services you use outside
the browser (mobile apps mostly)
* Port to Firefox
